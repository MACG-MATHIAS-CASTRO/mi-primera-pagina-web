my first website. The orientation around the club of which I am a fan, I tried to make it as complete as I could, although I know I can add many more things. I am sending you this initial work so that you can observe my performance.
apply the following tags
<body></body>
<a></a> to redirect link to other web pages
<p></p> body of note 
<li></li> listing
<ol></ol>numbered list
<ul></ul> sorted list
<center></center>center both titles, text 
<h1> </h1> main title
<h2></h2> secondary titles
<hr> to separate news 
<img> to add an image
It should be noted that I have only been at Henry for two days reading the information. 
It also looks for additional information to do different things to the page.
